        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>My name is Savannah Cole and I am a Junior at CodeRVA Regional High School. Im a student, athlete, and IT 
          specialist. The sports I'm in is muay thai and kickboxing. I've practice kickboxing for about three years
          and muay thai for six months. I've been an IT specialist for about six months.
        </p>
        <h2>What Am I Doing?</h2>
        <p>Right now I'm in an internship simulator provided by Maxx Potential where we simulate what it would be like to 
          work at a company. This internship is provided to all juniors at CodeRVA.
        </p>
        <h2>Whats Next?</h2>
        <p>I plan to graduate from CodeRVA with an advanced diploma and a few college credits. From there, I would go to 
          community college for two years then transfer to a universty to earn my Bachlors degree in Accounting. After 
          that, I'm hoping to get into the FBI vai their accounting sector.
        </p>
        <h2>What am I passionate about?</h2>
        <p>I have a few interests, but I mainly spend my time reading. I love reading and using my imagination to the 
          fullest. Reading allows me to have a break from life and be absorbed into a world of fantasy.
        </p>
        <h2>What Am I Looking For?</h2>
        <p>As of right now, I just want a job to pay for my car insurance. Im also starting to look for scholarships.</p>
